Random number generator seed: 3538149487475239631

Simulations of 5588 taxa, 1300 nucleotides
  for 1 tree(s) with 1 dataset(s) per tree

Alignment read: numSequences = 1, numAlignmentSites = 1300
Using sequence 1 as the ancestral sequence

Branch lengths assumed to be number of substitutions per site

Continuous gamma rate heterogeneity:
    shape = 0.405129
Model = GTR: General time reversible (nucleotides)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  rate matrix = gamma1: 1.7657 alpha1: 9.5876  beta1: 0.6919
                                beta2: 0.8633 alpha2:10.2826
                                              gamma2:  1.0000
  with nucleotide frequencies specified as:
  A=0.391 C=0.165 G=0.212 T=0.232
