This folder contains simulations that were run before the fix in the RDS algorithm that gives the correct sample size as requested in the configuration file. In this set of simulations (1) the seeds were not included as part of the sample, and (2) the last wave was allowed to finish no matter how many extra recruits it added. The simulations here for the social network have 2x-3x the requested sample size. This has been remedied in newer simulations.
